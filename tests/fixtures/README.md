# Test Fixtures

This directory contains sample files for testing the PDF parser.

## Files

- `sample.pdf` - A sample PDF file for testing (add your own PDF file here)

## Adding Test Files

To add test files:

1. Place your PDF files in this directory
2. Update the test files to reference them
3. Make sure they're small enough to be included in the repository

## Notes

- Keep test files small (< 1MB) to avoid repository bloat
- Use simple PDFs for consistent testing
- Include various types of PDFs (text-only, with images, etc.) for comprehensive testing
